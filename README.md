# Lung-Cancer-Detection-using-machine-learning
This project aims to develop an early detection system for lung cancer using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The system enhances medical imaging, segments the lung regions, and classifies the presence of cancer.Techniques like image scaling, contrast enhancement, and threshold-based segmentation are used to improve accuracy. The model can also predict the probability of lung cancer in high-risk patients, aiding radiologists in early diagnosis and improving patient outcomes.

Technologies used: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, SciPy, Anaconda.
